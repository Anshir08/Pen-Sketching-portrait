# Pen-Sketching-portrait

# Introduction
In this repository, you can easily make the portrait or pen sketch of any image with just a click.

And if you want you can use your laptop camera to grab the live image by uncommenting the part of code that i have put into comment in my main python file, before run the code.

Now you become an artist and actually faster than any sketcher with this code file, enjoy!!! :)

# About Files
In the Python_sketch folders there is a main python file and .exe file as well

In addition to these i put the two image files as example, 'abc.jpg' which is given as input file that will be converted into the sketch file 'New File.png' after the code runs.

and yeah!! also try the code with laptop cam as i told you in introduction.

# Libraries 
In the full python code, i just use one library - 'Open-cv' i.e., import cv2.
